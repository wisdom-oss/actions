<h3>actions</h3>
<p>‚èØ actions used in the WISdoM Organization to handle common tasks</p>
</div>

The [wisdom-oss] organization uses some longer github actions to allow 
synchronizing it's repositories to another server and uses actions to build it's
documentation for hosting it on GitHub pages.

The actions are sorted into the folders in the base directory of the repository.
The actions are always released as bundle which may lead to updates to only one
of the actions.
